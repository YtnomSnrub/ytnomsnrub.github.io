# Changing a Server's Haiku Type

You can change the way that Haikus are formatted in your server. This can be done with the `!haiku type` command. There are three options for haiku types for your server.

> To change the haiku type, the user sending the command must have the "Manage Guild" permission.

## Normal

```command
!haiku type default
```

The way that haikus are formatted are formatted by default. This option has a gap between lines.
