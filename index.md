HaikuBot is a friend-shaped Discord bot that detects accidental (or intentional) messages in your Discord server that can be turned into a 5-7-5 haiku, and then shows the message in haiku format. It uses a combination algorithms and a syllable dictionary to try to be accurate (although it still sometimes makes mistakes).

HaikuBot has a few fun tricks and secrets, but mostly stays out of the way unless you interact with it or it detects a haiku. If you have any questions, problems, and suggestions for the bot, or you just want to say hi, come join the [Official HaikuBot Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Cm5v93M).

## Modis

Modis is a modular discord bot, designed to be both flexible and easily extendable. It features a music module with an interactive GUI, as well as tools for moderation and a growing community developing new modules all the time. Modis is still in active development while we try to stabilise the framework and some of our internal modules, but you can come check out the community and the bot in our Discord server.
