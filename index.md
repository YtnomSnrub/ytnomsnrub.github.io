# YtnomSnrub

I like the way Snrub thinks! This is my GitHub page with the projects I'm working on.

## HaikuBot

HaikuBot is a Discord bot that detects accidental (or intentional) haikus in your Discord server, and formats them into a 5-7-5 message. It uses a dictionary of syllables to try and be as accurate as possible, also parsing acronyms, numbers, punctuation, and message formatting. HaikuBot has a few fun tricks and secrets, but mostly stays out of the way unless you interact with it or it detects a haiku.

## Modis

Modis is a modular discord bot, designed to be both flexible and easily extendable. It features a music module with an interactive GUI, as well as tools for moderation and a growing community developing new modules all the time. Modis is still in active development while we try to stabilise the framework and some of our internal modules, but you can come check out the community and the bot in our Discord server.
