## HaikuBot

HaikuBot is a Discord bot that detects accidental (or intentional) haikus in your Discord server, and formats them into a 5-7-5 message. It uses a dictionary of syllables to try and be as accurate as possible, also parsing acronyms, numbers, punctuation, and message formatting. HaikuBot has a few fun tricks and secrets, but mostly stays out of the way unless you interact with it or it detects a haiku.
